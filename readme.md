# Course outline

## What is the course based upon

1. The [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) modules written for the Mozilla Development Network's [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) course
2. [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
   - It's free!
3. React

I chose the MDN course because it is well written and has a clear progression. It also includes an embedded code editor in many lessons to help explore what we have just learnt.

When I first set out to learn JavaScript, Eloquent JavaScript (the first edition) was recommended to me and I found it a great way to learn. It is now in its third edition and has proven to be a great resource for learners over the years.

## Goal

The goal is to learn the fundamentals of modern front end web development (with React) so you can build a React project demonstrating what you know. Our time together is split up into three parts:

1. HTML & CSS
2. JavaScript
3. React

We have will cover a lot – especially in the first four weeks. Don't worry if you find you don't understand everything fully. When we get to React this is where we will have an opportunity to build and reinforce what we have learnt.

React is really just JavaScript, HTML, and CSS altogether.

The first two parts of the course will use free online tools that will allow us to run code and complete exercises and assignments in our browsers. The idea is to get feedback and delight immediately without having to worry about setting up a whole bunch of tools on our laptops – we'll do that later.

The assignments will be used to assess your progress in the course, so I know whether to move on to next topic or continue to review the current one.

The other goal we are going to accidentally learn is how to be curious and a self-directed learner.

## Expectations

This course is set up much like a study group. You'll be expected to do the readings and attempt all the exercises and assignments. Don't worry if you are unable to complete an exercises or assigment. We can go through it together when we meet!

I'll be here to mentor and facilitate your learning, but it is up to you to go through the material.
